    text: `## What League of Legends Taught Me

   I used to think I wasted thousands of hours of my life playing League of Legends. Looking back, that might not be 100% true. Here's what League of Legends taught me ðŸ¤”
   
   ### 	Strengths and Weaknesses
   ---
   I liked to think that I could play any style of champion and execute any strategy to the same level. After all, most champions are more similar than they are different right? 
   
   Unfortunately, I learned that not all champions were suitable for me the hard way. Now I know that losing 13 times on Cassiopeia doesn't mean I should try it a 14th time.
   
   Similarly, its a better investment to double down on what you're good at, than trying to marginally improve what you're weak at.
   
   ### Focus
   ---
   
   League of Legends isn't just a video game, it's also a verbal battlefield where 9 other players are judging your every move and ready to criticize you for it in the chat. For that reason, I was always ready to defend myself. 
   
   If you ever questioned my decision to farm the jungle instead of helping the team at Baron, I would respond with a carefully thought out rebuttal. If you called me a dog, I would probably inform you that a dog wouldn't be able to use a mouse since they don't have opposable thumbs. These back and forth conversations took over the gameplay and I was left with back to back death timers. Unsurprisingly, I would end up losing these games. Strangely enough, if I played with chat turned off, I would win a lot more games.
   
   Eventually, I learned that all of this was related to "attention theory". As humans, we only have finite amounts of attention at any given moment and sacrificing any amount to multitask lowers your performance a lot.
   
   Now, I purposely focus on one task at a single time without multitasking.
   
   ### Roles
   ---
   
   I played AD Carry which meant that although I had the highest damage per second on the team, I was also the squishiest (easiest to kill). This often means that I have to wait for my teammates to run into battle before me, so that I can avoid being dismantled in under a second.
   
   In real life, I hated waiting for others to do the job for me so I would always try to start the fight regardless of my role. As it played out, I would be immediately one shot and the rest of my team would get wiped.
   
   Looking back, the purpose of roles provides benefit in two forms:
   
  - Assigning people to their strengths
  - Ensuring that noone steps on other people's toes
   
   When I tried to do more, the result was less. That's how I learned to let others execute their role while I executed mine.
   
   ### Conclusion
   ---
   
   My Dad told me if you're going to play video games, you better play to win. Looking back, I'm glad I did. Now I'm able to reflect on some of my best moments over the years.`,
